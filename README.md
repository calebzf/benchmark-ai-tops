## 📚 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is GFLOPS and TOPS?

GFLOPS (Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second) measures how many calculations a processor can perform. TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) is used primarily for AI operations. Both metrics indicate performance levels.

### Is it safe to use this application?

Yes, benchmark-ai-tops has been tested extensively to ensure safety and reliability. It does not collect personal data or require internet access for testing.

### Do I need to pay for this application?

No. benchmark-ai-tops is completely free to download and use.
